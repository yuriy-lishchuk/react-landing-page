      <h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
      <p>Last updated April 04, 2020</p>

      <h1>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h1>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between
        you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and
        refractor_labs ("Company", “we”, “us”, or “our”), concerning your access
        to and use of the https://beta.prysm.xyz website as well as any other
        media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related,
        linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). You
        agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed
        to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL
        OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE
        SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY. Supplemental terms and
        conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time
        are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the
        right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these
        Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any
        changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and
        you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It
        is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay
        informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have
        been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised
        Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such
        revised Terms of Use are posted. The information provided on the Site is
        not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
        jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary
        to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration
        requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those
        persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on
        their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with
        local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The Site is
        not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal
        Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your
        interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site.
        You may not use the Site in a way that would violate the
        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The Site is intended for users who are at
        least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in
        which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the
        permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian
        to use the Site. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or
        guardian read and agree to these Terms of Use prior to you using the
        Site.
